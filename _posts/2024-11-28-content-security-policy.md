    <h1>Content Security Policy (CSP)</h1>
    <p>
        The internet has transformed the way we live, work, and communicate, but it also comes with its fair share of challenges—especially 
        when it comes to security. As cyberattacks grow more sophisticated, web developers must adopt robust mechanisms to protect their 
        websites and users. One such powerful tool is <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong>. Think of CSP as a safety net that keeps your 
        website safe from malicious actors trying to sneak in harmful code or hijack user interactions.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this post, we’ll dive deep into CSP—what it is, why it’s critical, and how you can use it to secure your website against common threats 
        like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and clickjacking. Let’s get started!
    </p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>What is Content Security Policy (CSP)?</h2>
    <p>
        Imagine you’re running a restaurant, and you decide to let only trusted suppliers deliver food to your kitchen. Similarly, 
        <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong> is a browser feature that allows you to define which content sources are trusted for 
        your website. By setting up rules (directives), CSP tells the browser:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Which sources of scripts, styles, images, or other resources are allowed.</li>
        <li>What actions users can perform, such as embedding frames or executing inline code.</li>
        <li>Where to report violations if someone tries to break the rules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If the browser detects an attempt to load or execute something that doesn’t match the policy, it blocks the action. This effectively 
        stops many types of attacks before they can even begin.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Does Your Website Need CSP?</h2>
    <p>
        Cybersecurity threats like <strong>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)</strong> and <strong>clickjacking</strong> are more common than you might think. 
        Without proper safeguards, an attacker could inject harmful scripts into your website, steal sensitive user data, or trick users into 
        clicking on hidden elements. Here’s why CSP is crucial:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Stops XSS Attacks:</strong> By allowing only trusted scripts to execute, CSP helps block malicious code injections.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Prevents Clickjacking:</strong> With directives like <code>frame-ancestors</code>, CSP ensures your website can only be embedded 
            in trusted frames, protecting users from hidden manipulations.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Limits Third-Party Risks:</strong> CSP restricts third-party content, reducing the chances of compromised external scripts 
            harming your site.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>In short, CSP acts as a protective layer that ensures only the resources you trust are used by your website.</p>
</section>

<section>
    <h2>How CSP Works</h2>
    <p>
        When a browser loads your website, it checks for the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header in your server response or a 
        <code>&lt;meta&gt;</code> tag in your HTML. This header contains a set of rules (directives) that dictate what the browser can do.
    </p>
    <p>For example:</p>
    <pre>
<code>Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; img-src https://trusted-images.com; script-src 'self' https://cdn.scripts.com</code>
</pre>
    <p>This tells the browser:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All resources (scripts, images, styles, etc.) should come from the website itself (<code>'self'</code>) unless otherwise specified.</li>
        <li>Images can also be loaded from <code>https://trusted-images.com</code>.</li>
        <li>Scripts can only come from the website itself or <code>https://cdn.scripts.com</code>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        If a script from an untrusted source tries to run, the browser blocks it and logs a violation, giving you insight into 
        potential attacks or misconfigurations.
    </p>

    <h2>How CSP Protects Your Website</h2>
    <p>
        A <strong>Content Security Policy (CSP)</strong> acts as a robust security layer that helps mitigate a wide range of attacks. 
        By implementing CSP, you can enforce strict rules on how and where your website’s resources are loaded or executed. 
        Here’s what CSP can do for your website:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>Define Permitted Sources:</strong> Specify trusted sources for JavaScript, styles, images, and other resources. 
            This effectively blocks any unauthorized resources from domains like <code>https://evil.example.com</code>.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Disable Inline Script Tags:</strong> Prevent the execution of inline scripts embedded directly in HTML, 
            which are often a target for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Allow Scripts with Nonce or Hash:</strong> Permit only those scripts that include a valid <code>nonce</code> 
            (a unique, server-generated token) or a matching hash, ensuring only authorized inline content is executed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Disable Inline Event Handlers:</strong> Block inline event handlers, such as <code>onclick</code>, 
            <code>onmouseover</code>, or <code>onload</code>, which can be exploited by attackers to execute malicious code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Disable JavaScript URLs:</strong> Prevent execution of URLs beginning with <code>javascript:</code>, 
            which can be used for injection attacks or redirecting users to malicious scripts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Restrict Dangerous APIs:</strong> Block the use of insecure APIs like <code>eval()</code>, <code>Function()</code>, 
            and similar methods that can execute arbitrary code.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        By implementing these rules, CSP not only strengthens your website’s security but also ensures that resources and 
        scripts are loaded only from sources you trust, minimizing potential attack vectors.
    </p>

<section>
<p>A CSP should be delivered to the browser in the Content-Security-Policy response header.
It should be set on all responses to all requests, not just the main document.</p>
<p>
The policy is specified as a series of directives, separated by semi-colons. Each directive controls a different aspect
of the security policy. Each directive has a name, followed by a space, followed by a value. Different directives
can have different syntaxes.
</p>

    <h2>Step-by-Step: Setting Up CSP</h2>
    <p>Implementing CSP might seem intimidating at first, but it’s a straightforward process. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>
    <h3>1. Add the CSP Header</h3>
    <p>
        The easiest way to enable CSP is by adding the <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> header in your server configuration. Here’s how it’s done:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>For Apache:</strong></li>
        <pre>
<code>Header set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; script-src 'self' https://cdn.scripts.com"</code>
</pre>
        <li><strong>For Nginx:</strong></li>
        <pre>
<code>add_header Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'; img-src https://*; script-src 'self' https://cdn.scripts.com";</code>
</pre>
    </ul>
    <h3>2. Use Report-Only Mode for Testing</h3>
    <p>
        Start with <strong>report-only mode</strong> to avoid accidentally breaking your website. This mode logs violations without blocking them, 
        giving you a chance to identify issues before enforcing the policy. Here’s how it looks:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>Content-Security-Policy-Report-Only: default-src 'self'; report-uri https://your-site.com/csp-reports</code>
</pre>
    <h3>3. Handle Inline Scripts and Styles</h3>
    <p>
        If your website relies on inline scripts or styles, CSP will block them unless explicitly allowed. Use <code>nonce</code> or 
        <code>hash</code> to permit specific inline content safely:
    </p>
    <pre>
<code>Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' 'nonce-unique123';</code>
</pre>
    <p>Corresponding script tag:</p>
    <pre>
<code>&lt;script nonce="unique123"&gt;
console.log('Secure inline script');
&lt;/script&gt;
</code>
</pre>
    <h3>4. Gradually Refine Your Policy</h3>
    <p>
        As you monitor reports and test your policy, start tightening the rules. For instance, replace broad directives like <code>'unsafe-inline'</code> 
        with more specific ones like <code>'nonce'</code> or trusted domains.
    </p>

    <h2>Common CSP Directives You Should Know</h2>
    <p>
        CSP provides a wide range of directives for fine-grained control over resource loading. Here are some of the most important ones:
    </p>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Directive</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>default-src</code></td>
                <td>Fallback for all other resource types if not explicitly specified.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>script-src</code></td>
                <td>Defines allowed sources for JavaScript.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>img-src</code></td>
                <td>Defines allowed sources for images.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>style-src</code></td>
                <td>Defines allowed sources for CSS.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>connect-src</code></td>
                <td>Specifies allowed endpoints for network requests (e.g., AJAX, WebSocket).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>frame-ancestors</code></td>
                <td>Restricts where your website can be embedded (to prevent clickjacking).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>report-uri</code></td>
                <td>Specifies the endpoint for logging CSP violations.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
